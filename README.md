# ES2_Eclectic_Boogaloo
## Coursework 2 Brief

Write firmware for precision motor control of a
brushless motor  
• With bitcoin mining

Main functions:
1. Spin for a defined number of rotations and stop
without overshooting
2. Spin at a defined angular velocity
3. Execute a bitcoin mining kernel in the background
4. Make the motor play a tune as it works
